# AetherOS | The Liquid Intelligence Landing Page

AetherOS is a cinematic, high-performance landing page representing the next generation of autonomous AI operating systems. Built with a focus on deep 3D immersion, fluid motion, and premium glassmorphic aesthetics.

## ✨ Features

- **🎬 3D Cinematic Scroll**: A layered section architecture where content recedes and emerges in 3D space (Z-axis, Rotation, Scaling) as you scroll.
- **🌊 Liquid Smooth Scroll**: Integrated with **Lenis** for high-precision, momentum-based scrolling.
- **🌌 Three.js Particle Field**: A dynamic, mouse-interactive star/atom field that responds to user movement.
- **🛰️ The Integrated Mesh**: An interactive 3D orbiter visualizing ecosystem integrations with glowing neural bridges.
- **📟 Low-Level Kernel Simulation**: A live terminal component showing real-time kernel logs with CRT scanline effects.
- **🧬 The Autonomous Pipeline**: A scroll-triggered timeline visualization of intent-to-execution logic.
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Custom adaptive 3D logic that tones down depth transforms for mobile/tablet while maintaining premium feel.
- **💎 Glassmorphic Design System**: Advanced CSS glass-panel effects with dynamic spotlight glows and silver accents.
